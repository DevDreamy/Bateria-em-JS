# JS-DrumKit

This web application is built using HTML/CSS/Vanilla JS. You can play a drumkit using your keyboard or clicking on the icons.

This project was made based on the 30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge.

### Some changes Iâ€™ve made from the original project:
-	Made it's icons work as buttons, so the user can play the sounds using a smarthone/tablet.
-	Implemented responsive design.
